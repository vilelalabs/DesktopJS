Project created and updated live at  [Twitch.Tv/HenriqueVilelaMusic](https://twitch.tv/henriquevilelamusic)
*DesktopJS is known by the EasyTwitchBot name*
### This bot will not be updated!
### Changed to [VilelaBot](https://github.com/vilelalabs/VilelaBot) (more lighter, without UI from electronjs and with more resources)

# ðŸ¤–Easy Twitch Bot

The idea of this project is to give permission for twitch chatters and audience to create new commands for everyone to use in chat.
Another feature is to have a Desktop UI to login with the twitch OAuth and to see the commands and _other future features will be added_.

### Recursos Folder
This folder have example files that are created and updated by the own app.

### Auto authenticator
In order to make an auto authenticator, you have to change the **auth2.js** filename to **auth.js** and fill the correct value of the auth variable inside (signed by **TWITCH_OAUTH**).

### Ads
Running ads automatically (see details at the top of the file **ad.js**)
(...)

### OBS
For now, only a option to make visible or not the EasyTwitchBot UI with a function on **obs.js** module.

### Stream Holics
The bot has a file called **sh.js** that makes an automatic 'advertise' for the channels listed on the **streamers** array.

### Other
- **package-lock.json** file not included
